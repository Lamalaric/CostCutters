TO DO LIST

HEADER:
	- Contact us page needed 
	- recipe's page should scroll down to recipes we need 4x recipe pages

SECTION 1:
	- 'create a recipe' scroll needs implementation
	- saved recipes display not implemented
	- import recipe not implemented and should be open recipe to keep it all around the database. 
	  Use pop ups in JavaScript to keep website tidy 

Final section:
	- I have no idea of its use what we intend to use it for seems like a duplicate of section 1
	- perhaps merge with find cheapest and use that one section to display the imports too 

footer 
	- individual page with private policy, tos and about us is perfect and needs to be added. All can link to the same but with anchors to scroll to
